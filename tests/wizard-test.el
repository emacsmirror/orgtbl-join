;;; Commentary:
;; A Lisp function to record a wizard unit test.
;; - put the cursor somewhere in an Org Mode file,
;; - call M-x orgtbl-join-bench-create
;; - call the wizard with
;;   C-c C-x x join
;; - use the wizard as usual, your key-strokes are recorded while you type,
;; - when done, hit the & key,
;;   this insert a keyboard macro in the Org Mode file,
;; - the keyboard macro can be executed anytime with C-x e
;;   to replicate your actions.

(defun orgtbl-join-bench-create ()

When done, type &."

Do not call it directly."
